# New Algorithm Development

Welcome! This repository is for developing a new algorithm. 

I want to develop a **new algorithm** for my university project. I have intermediate knowledge of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) and my goal is to develop an efficient and innovative approach. Currently, the exploration involves identifying inefficiencies in existing algorithms and leveraging those insights to develop a more effective approach. If you have ideas for new problems that could benefit from a novel algorithm, Iâ€™d love to hear them!
